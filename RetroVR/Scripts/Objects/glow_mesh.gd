## Makes named meshes inside an instanced GLB read as lit.
##
## Downloaded fixtures usually ship ONE material shared by every part — the
## ceiling fan uses `Ceiling_Fan_Mat` for its blades, housing, downrod and glass
## alike — so emission cannot simply be switched on at the material or the whole
## fixture glows. This duplicates the material on the named meshes only, the same
## way bedroom_exterior.gd duplicates before retinting.
##
## Registers in the "light_glow" group so a switch can darken the glass at the
## same time it kills the light; otherwise flipping the switch leaves a glowing
## shade over an unlit room.

## Mesh node names to make emissive, matched exactly against MeshInstance3D.name.
## The ceiling fan's glass globe exports as "defaultMaterial4" — the GLB names
## every part after the material it uses, so these are positional, not
## descriptive. Re-check them if the model is ever replaced.

## Meshes to turn into LIT GLASS — a shade you can see the bulb through.
##
## Without this the only way to show a fixture was on was to make the shade itself
## emissive, which lights up the glass and leaves the bulb inside it dark. The
## fan's globe is opaque in the GLB (one material for the whole fixture), so the
## spiral CFL modelled inside it was invisible and could not be the thing that
## glowed. Making the globe translucent puts the bulb back on show.
