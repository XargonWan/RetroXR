## PageGrab — pinch a page of an open book and drag it over.
##
## Interaction (VR + desktop), following the VRButton/VRHinge house pattern:
##   • HOVER — a controller's poke tip inside the zone, or the desktop reticle
##     over it, arms the grab and shows the book's page hint.
##   • HELD  — pull the TRIGGER to latch. The point of the page you were
##     touching is the point that follows your hand from then on, so a corner
##     gives a corner curl and a mid-edge grip gives a mid-edge fold. Once
##     latched the hand may roam anywhere; only releasing the trigger lets go.
##
## The trigger is deliberate: GRIP already means "pick up the whole book"
## (XRToolsPickable), so the two never fight over the same squeeze.
##
## The zone covers the outer part of a page rather than all of it. The Area3D is
## on the pointer layer, and InteractionResolver ranks a pointer-interactive
## area (250) above a pickable (100) — covering the whole page would leave the
## laser no way to pick the book up.
