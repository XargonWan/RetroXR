## RetroSystemModelPSP — Sony PlayStation Portable (PSP-1000, 480×272 widescreen).
##
## Uses an author's detailed imported shell (psp_1000.glb), which — unlike the
## older bare shell — models every control as its own mesh: the ✕○□△ face
## buttons, the d-pad, the analog nub, the L/R shoulders, Start/Select/Home, the
## volume ± and sound/display keys, the slide POWER switch, the EJECT latch and
## the UMD door. That is what lets the pad animate and the tray open.
##
## Media is the UMD (psp_umd.glb, systemid "playstation_portable"), which loads
## through the back-edge UMD door rather than a top slot.
class_name RetroSystemModelPSP

## The PSP-1000 shell suffixes its lens mesh "screen_mesh_0".

# --- power slide ------------------------------------------------------------

## The PSP powers on with a SLIDE, not a button — the switch on the right edge
## pushes up toward the top of the device.
##
## The VRSlider owns the real PowerButton cap (set_knob_mesh), so the switch you
## see IS the knob: it traces the pointer highlight and travels with the value.
## This used to be a second, parallel mechanism — the slider drove a hidden
## placeholder while a bespoke _set_power_mesh() slid the real mesh off the
## value_changed signal — which left the cap unlit under the pointer and the
## travel axis defined in two places. Direction and throw are authored on the
## slider in psp.tscn.
##
## That axis is NOT a cardinal direction. The right edge tapers — it is widest at
## the bottom and narrows toward the top — so the cap has to travel along the
## surface it sits in, about 19 degrees off -Z. Sliding it straight along -Z (the
## obvious reading of "pushes up") buries it 1.4 mm into the shell over a 4 mm
## throw. The authored (0.320634, 0, -0.947203) is the shell's own edge tangent,
## least-squares fitted across the travel span at the switch's height; the cap
## mesh's principal axis independently agrees to within 1.5 degrees.

# --- volume ------------------------------------------------------------------

## The PSP has no volume SLIDER — it has two buttons, and the shell models them:
## "Button Minus" and "Button Plus", 4.7 x 3.4 mm each, side by side on the face
## just above the bottom lip. The inherited VolumeSlider was authored at
## x = +0.087 against a shell that ends at +0.0815, so it floated a few mm off
## the right edge, nowhere near either button, driving nothing you could see.
##
## With the buttons doing the job the slider is gone from psp.tscn entirely, so
## this owns the level itself. That is the whole of what the slider was still
## providing: handheld_model wires _volume_slider.value_changed to the host and
## re-applies its position on power-on, and both of those are null-guarded, so
## deleting the node just means doing the two calls here.

# --- UMD door latch ----------------------------------------------------------

## The UMD door is released by a SPRUNG LATCH on the back edge, not a button: you
## push it along the edge and the door pops, and it springs straight back. That is
## the same mechanism as the power switch, so it is the same class
## (VRSpringReturnSlider) — but with no dwell. The power switch has to be HELD to
## mean it; the latch fires the moment it reaches the end of its throw, which is
## what on_hold_sec = 0 with a 0.98 threshold buys.
##
## It travels along +X, toward the R shoulder. The shell prints "OPEN ———▷" beside
## it with the arrow pointing that way, and the strip's own principal axis is pure
## X (10.3 mm long, 0.7 mm thick) — a slide, not a press. It used to be mounted as
## the cabinet's generic eject VRButton with depress_axis = -_press_dir, i.e.
## driven along the FACE normal, so pressing it shoved the latch through the edge
## sideways-on.
##
## Reports intent, not position, so the door OPENS every time — it never toggles.
## Pushing it shut again is the door's own job (see _configure_umd_door, which
## calls request_tray_state(false) when the hinge is pushed to the closed stop).

# --- UMD door + eject -------------------------------------------------------

## The UMD lives behind a hinged door on the back — a real mesh ("PSP UMD
## Deckel22"; "Deckel" is German for "lid/cover", same shell as the German-named
## AVKabel/PowerKabel cable meshes) on a real back-edge hinge, a
## VRSpringLatchedHinge rig (same idea as the disc consoles' lids —
## Dreamcast/PS2/Saturn) rather than trusting the GLB's own door
## animation/pivot empty ("PSP UMD Deckel"), which (like those consoles'
## broken Close clips) doesn't drive the mesh correctly. This gives the door a
## real spring: EJECT pops it open, and it can be grabbed and pushed shut by
## hand — it only latches when released near the closed limit.
##
## Baked into psp.tscn as UMDDoorPivot (with the door + UMD Schacht liner
## reparented onto it) / UMDDoorPivot/UMDDoorHinge / .../CollisionShape3D —
## same idiom as playstation_one.tscn's LidMount/LidPivot/LidHinge — rather
## than built at runtime. The pivot hinges at the door's real edge (its
## global-Z-MAXIMUM, the opposite end from the disc consoles' lids) with a
## 180°-about-Y yaw so the door swings DOWN and away from the shell instead
## of up through it; the hinge's grab box only covers the free (swinging)
## half of the door, away from the pivot. See Tools/bake_psp.gd in history
## for how it was built, if it ever needs rebuilding from a fresh GLB.
