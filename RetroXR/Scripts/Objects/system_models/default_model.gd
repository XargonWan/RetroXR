## The serial socket, on the back panel beside the A/V row.
##
## Asked of SystemInfo rather than named here, so this is the same switch that
## shows the memory-card slot: a console either has the socket or it does not,
## and that is a fact about the hardware rather than about this box.
##
## Placed at x = 0.045 against the A/V row's 0.082 upward. The 37 mm gap is what
## the number is for: a 21 mm shell and a phono plug reached for at the same time
## should not be fighting over the same handful of panel.
##
## Not an attempt at the real console's panel order. This box is the stand-in
## every machine without a model of its own wears, and it is not a PlayStation
## shape to begin with; a shell that draws its own back panel puts the socket
## where the mould actually has it by overriding this.
##
## Same turn as configure_av_ports uses -- 180 degrees about X, so the socket's
## local +Z points out of the panel, which is where a plug arrives from -- but
## NOT the same z, and the difference is the whole of it. A port sits where the
## seated plug's ORIGIN belongs, and the two connectors put their origin in
## different places: a phono plug's is 10 mm out from the panel with its barrel
## reaching back to it, so rca_port pushes its jack back by that same 10 mm to
## land the flange on the panel. This connector's origin is its mating face,
## which stops about a millimetre proud. Copying the phono row's -0.135 left the
## socket hanging 10 mm off the back of the console with the plug's nose ending
## 3 mm short of it -- close enough to read as seated in a render, which is why
## it took a measurement rather than a look.
