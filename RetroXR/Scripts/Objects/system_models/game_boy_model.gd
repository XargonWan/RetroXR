## RetroSystemModelGameBoy — original DMG Game Boy (portrait, 160×144 LCD).
## The primitive stand-in shell lives in game_boy.tscn (store-safe fallback); when
## the detailed imported DMG GLB is present it's swapped in by the base (dev-only).
class_name RetroSystemModelGameBoy

## Classic DMG dot-matrix green LCD filter, applied to the built-in screen.

## Align the cart with the shell's own slot marker ACROSS the body — the base
## centres it on the body's mid-plane, but the DMG's connector sits ~1 cm below
## that, so on a 3 cm-thick shell the card sat visibly off the real slot.
##
## Only x/y come from the marker; the depth is set so the cart's outer end lands
## FLUSH with the top of the shell, like real hardware — a Game Boy cartridge
## drops fully into the back recess rather than standing proud. (Seating the
## contacts on the marker instead left 30 mm of a 65 mm cart hanging out, and
## the base's _cart_protrude() convention still left ~18 mm.) The marker's basis
## already encodes the right pose — length running out of the top mouth, label
## facing the console's back.
## Falls back to the base placement when the detailed GLB is absent.

## Hand the power switch the shell's own cap ("Pulsante_Accensione", the tab on
## the top edge) instead of leaving it driving a hidden placeholder KnobMesh.
##
## Direction and throw are authored on the slider in game_boy.tscn: the DMG
## moulds "OFF ◄ ► ON" into the top edge and ships the cap parked at the -X end
## of its slot, which is OFF — so ON is +X. The slot is ~10 mm long against a
## 4 mm cap, hence the 6 mm throw.
