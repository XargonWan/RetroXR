## SensorBar — the Wii's sensor bar, which senses nothing.
##
## It is two clusters of infrared LEDs on a stick. The camera in the nose of the
## Wii Remote is what does the looking, and everything about where the pointer
## lands comes from where these two lights are in the room. That is the reason
## this is an object you can pick up and put somewhere rather than a position
## computed off the television: with `dolphin_ir_passthrough` on, the frontend
## hands Dolphin the camera's real view of these LEDs, so moving the bar moves the
## aim — the same way it does at home when someone knocks it off the set.
##
## It talks to no core. WiiLink owns the console end (which console this bar
## belongs to, and which way up it is sitting relative to the screen), and
## wiimote.gd reads `led_positions()` once a frame. This file is the object.
