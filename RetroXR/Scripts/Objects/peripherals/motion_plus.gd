## MotionPlus, the dongle that clips onto the foot of a Wii Remote and gives it
## a gyroscope.
##
## The only accessory in this room that is both a PLUG and a SOCKET. It seats in
## the remote's expansion port the way a Nunchuk's connector does, and carries a
## port of its own on its far end so the Nunchuk still has somewhere to go. That
## pass-through is the whole shape of the real accessory, and it is why the core's
## device ids DOUBLE rather than gaining one: every extension can still be fitted,
## into the dongle instead of into the remote.
##
## It sends nothing to libretro itself. The remote owns the slot and derives the
## rotation from its own tracked motion, so all this has to do is be somewhere:
## seated, the remote announces a device id ending _MP and Dolphin attaches the
## emulated dongle; pulled, it announces the plain one and the emulated remote
## loses its gyroscope, which is what bare hardware does, and why Wii Sports
## Resort will not play without one.

## What this reports to whatever socket it is offered to, and what the remote's
## expansion port narrows on. Non-empty on purpose: RetroSystem._accepts_plug
## rejects any plug whose systemid is not the console's, which keeps a dongle out
## of every cabinet socket in the room the same way it keeps the Nunchuk cord out.

## this is a 46 mm block and a hint at its height would float clear of it.

## Retries for the deferred re-seat on load. Bounded rather than "until it works",

## otherwise reschedule this every idle frame for the life of the session.

## The Nunchuk in the pass-through changed. The remote cannot watch this zone
