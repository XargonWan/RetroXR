## KeyboardKeyField — makes a RetroKeyboard's caps clickable with the desktop
## reticle / VR laser.
##
## Exists as a separate Area3D rather than as methods on the board because
## InteractionResolver._classify tests `is XRToolsPickable` BEFORE
## `has_method("pointer_event")`. RetroKeyboard *is* an XRToolsPickable, so a
## pointer_event on the board itself would never fire — every click would grab the
## keyboard instead. Hit as its own area it classifies as KIND_POINTER
## (can_grab = false), which both routes the press here and blocks the pickup.
##
## It also has to sit on POINTABLE_LAYER, and it sits INSIDE the board's own grab
## body — measured at 1 mm behind its surface. The resolver walks front to back,
## so the board is hit first; what hands the press here instead is
## InteractionResolver.ENCLOSURE_DEPTH, which lets a control win from up to 50 mm
## inside the thing housing it. A field further in than that would stop working.
##
## The individual caps have no colliders of their own — they are bare meshes —
## so this is one box over the whole grid and the board resolves which key was hit
## from the collision point via its existing rect lookup.

## every aim anywhere on the keyboard and the board can never be picked up by
## pointing at the surround, the palm rest or the back edge.
