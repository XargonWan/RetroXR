## VRSpringReturnSlider — a MOMENTARY slide switch: it can be pushed off its rest
## position, but springs back the instant you let go, and only does anything if
## you HELD it there long enough.
##
## This is the PSP's power switch. Sony's manual gives three positions, and only
## one of them latches:
##   • slide UP                     → turn the system on (or sleep, when running)
##   • slide UP and hold  > 3 s     → turn the system OFF
##   • slide DOWN                   → HOLD, locks the buttons (a latching detent)
## The UP end is spring-loaded and returns to the middle by itself — owners who
## reassemble a PSP-1000 with that spring missing report having to push the switch
## back down by hand "or it would turn off again", which is the same mechanism
## seen from the other side.
##
## The DOWN/HOLD detent is deliberately not modelled: RetroXR has nothing for a
## button lock to disable, so it would move the cap and change nothing.
##
## Unlike the plain VRSlider this reports an INTENT, not a position — a flick that
## springs back before the dwell elapses is not a power change, so the owner wires
## toggle_requested rather than value_changed. Leave `steps` at 0 in the scene:
## detents would snap the spring-back instead of letting it travel.
