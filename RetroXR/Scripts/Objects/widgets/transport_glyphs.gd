## TransportGlyphs — the transport symbols the TV remote prints, shared with the
## front panels of the decks it drives.
##
## One table for both, so a deck's PLAY key and the remote's PLAY key cannot drift
## into two different symbols. The codepoints are Font Awesome / Material Design
## in the Symbols Nerd Font, which has to be chained onto the label's own font or
## every one of them renders as tofu.
