## VRLever — a throw lever with a continuous 0..1 value, on a wall or a panel.
##
## VRHinge is already the whole interaction: trigger-latched grab with 0.6/0.4
## hysteresis, gated on PokeTip.is_poking() so a hand holding something cannot grab
## it, offset bookkeeping so taking hold never teleports the arm, clamped between two
## angles, and the open-palm / fist hint icon. This adds exactly two things to it.
##
## 1. DESKTOP PRESS-DRAG. VRHinge deliberately gates its pointer tracking on
##    use_xr: on desktop a press only LATCHES and the mouse WHEEL rolls the angle,
##    which is right for a lid you nudge to a position. A lever is swept, so the
##    press has to drag. The wheel still works while held, as the fine adjustment.
##
## 2. A VALUE. The angle is what the hinge knows; a lever's consumer wants 0..1.
##    value_at_min / value_at_max let the scene pick which end is zero, so a lever
##    reading right-to-left needs no sign juggling at the far end.
##
## Overriding here rather than in VRHinge on purpose: every clamshell lid, disc door,
## cartridge flap and battery cover in the project is a VRHinge, and they all want
## the wheel-only desktop behaviour they have now.

## Emitted on every change, including while dragging. A consumer that does real work
## should throttle — see TimeOfDay.min_apply_interval.
signal value_changed(value: float)

## Emitted once, on the frame the hand or the pointer lets go. For the work that
## should happen at the END of a sweep rather than throughout it — writing a
## preference to disk, say.
signal released(value: float)

## Value reported at each end of the throw. Reversed by default (min_deg = 1) so a
## lever that reads left-to-right on a wall maps left = 0 without negating anything.

## and the hand is chasing it.
