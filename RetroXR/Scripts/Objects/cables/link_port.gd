## The serial socket on a handheld — the GBA's link port.
##
## An RcaPort with a different mouth and a different consequence. Everything the
## seating machinery needs is already inherited: RcaPort.GROUP membership so a
## plug can find the socket holding it, the has_picked_up / has_dropped hooks,
## and plug_group() gating so a link lead will not go into a phono jack.
##
## What differs is what a seated cable MEANS. An A/V lead resolves through
## AvGraph into a routing decision; this one resolves into two emulator cores
## being told they share a wire, which is LinkCable's job rather than this
## socket's. All this adds is a way to find the machine that owns the socket and
## the core running inside it.
##
## `channel` is inherited but meaningless here, so it is pinned rather than left
## for a scene to set wrong: a link cable carries neither picture nor sound.

## Which of the machine's link ports this socket is. A Game Boy Advance has one;
## the export exists because a GameCube has four, and the API this ultimately
## drives is addressed by port from the start.

## cable wants the thing running a core instead, so it walks for that.

## The cable this socket belongs to, when it is the junction moulded into a lead
## rather than a socket on a machine.
##
## A link cable carries an inline junction so a third and fourth player can chain
## in, and that junction is a real socket on a scene object with no core behind
## it. It conducts rather than participates, so the chain walk has to be able to
## tell the two kinds of socket apart: a machine port answers get_machine(), a
## junction answers this.

## The Libretro node behind this socket, or null when the machine is off. Null is
## ordinary rather than exceptional: a cable can be seated into a console that
## has not been switched on yet, and it should simply come alive when it is.
