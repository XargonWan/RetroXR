## A PlayStation link cable — the SCPH-1040.
##
## A grey cord with an identical connector at each end, joining the serial
## sockets on the back of two consoles. Wipeout, Doom, Destruction Derby and
## Formula 1 all take one; the second console needs its own copy of the disc.
##
## Two consoles and no more. That is the difference from the Game Boy Advance
## lead and it is what makes this a separate class rather than a LinkCable with a
## different plug on it. A GBA lead carries an inline junction so a third and
## fourth player can chain onto the same wire, and most of LinkCable is about
## walking those chains and deciding who is player one. A PlayStation link cable
## is a null modem between peers: transmit crossed to receive, DTR to DSR, RTS to
## CTS, both ways. Neither console owns the clock, there is no seat to assign,
## and there is nothing in the middle to walk through. So this is the GameCube
## lead's shape — a plain CompositeCable that resolves a pair — with the ends
## symmetric instead of asymmetric.
##
## What it resolves into is one call: the two cores are told they share a wire.
## Everything after that is theirs. Whether the running core can carry a link at
## all is not this cable's business either: a core that never joins the bus
## leaves the lead sitting there doing nothing, which is also what happens when
## the console on the other end is switched off.
