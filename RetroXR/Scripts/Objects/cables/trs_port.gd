## One 3.5 mm TRS socket on a device — the tower's line out, the speakers' line in.
##
## An RcaPort with a different mouth. Everything the A/V topology needs is already
## there: RcaPort.GROUP membership so a plug can find the socket holding it,
## get_device() so a link resolves to the machine that owns the socket, and the
## OUT/IN direction that decides which way a cord carries.
##
## The `channel` export is inherited but not a choice here. A TRS connector carries
## BOTH channels down one plug, which is what Channel.AUDIO_STEREO exists to say, so
## it is pinned in _ready rather than left for a scene to get wrong. There is no
## crossed-channel case to model either — unlike a pair of phono cords, a stereo
## plug cannot be put in half way round.
##
## The jack visual is a child named TrsJack, so RcaPort's own _tint_jack and
## show_jack — both of which look for a child named RcaJack — find nothing and no-op.
## That is deliberate: the green collar is baked into the mesh, and PC99's colour
## code is a property of the socket's function, not something a scene picks.
