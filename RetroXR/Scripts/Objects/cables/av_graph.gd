## AvGraph — what is wired to what, asked once instead of worked out three times.
##
## A cable reports only its OWN cords, so a device told about a change by one lead
## used to learn nothing about the others. A console already worked around that by
## re-walking every port it owns (RetroSystem._all_links); the decks did not, so a
## deck fed by two leads had its whole routing overwritten by whichever of them
## resolved last — picture from one, sound from the other, and the loser silently
## dropped. The walk lives here now, and everything asks it the same way.
##
## Static, and there is no registry to keep in step: RcaPort puts every socket in
## its own group as it enters the tree, so the question is answered from the scene
## rather than from a cache that can drift out of date.

## Every link on every cable that touches `dev`, as {out, in, cord} dictionaries
## with the direction already resolved. Duplicates are impossible — each cable is
## visited once — but a cord that reaches `dev` twice legitimately appears once
## per cable.
