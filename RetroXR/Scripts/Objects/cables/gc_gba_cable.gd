## A GameCube-to-Game Boy Advance lead.
##
## The DOL-011: a purple cord with a wide grey plug for a console's controller
## socket at one end and a grey barrel for a handheld's EXT port at the other.
## Four Swords Adventures gives every player one, and the handheld becomes their
## controller and their second screen.
##
## What it resolves into differs from a link cable in two ways, and both come
## from the machines not being peers.
##
## The console ASKS and the handheld ANSWERS. That is a different conversation
## from two handhelds trading a word each, so it carries a different protocol id
## on the bus, and the bus refuses to join one to the other. Physically a Game
## Boy Advance has one EXT socket and what is in it decides who it talks to, so
## the handheld keeps two bus ports and the CABLE picks which one it means.
##
## And the console has to be told what is on the port. A handheld on a GameCube
## lead is a controller as far as the machine is concerned, so seating the plug
## announces its device type the way any pad's would -- there is no separate step
## and nothing else to configure. Pulling it out puts the port back.
