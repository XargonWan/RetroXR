## PosterConform — wraps a poster's sheet onto the real shape of what it is stuck to.
##
## WHY IT SAMPLES THE VISUAL MESH AND NOT THE COLLIDER. Walls are honest — a
## StaticBody3D whose BoxShape3D IS the wall — but most furniture is a GLB with one
## crude box around it, and several loose props carry no collider at all. A poster
## conformed to a CRT's box collider is a flat poster floating in front of the CRT,
## which is the exact case this mode exists for.
##
## So the target's visible meshes are cooked into a throwaway trimesh body on a
## private layer, and the grid is raycast against THAT. Jolt is then the broadphase;
## the alternative is a per-triangle loop in GDScript over a 15k-triangle shell for
## every one of a few hundred grid points.
##
## Walls skip all of it: a body in the "poster_flat" group means "this collider is
## the surface", and the sheet stays flat. That is author intent because it cannot
## be inferred — a box that IS the shape and a box that LIES about the shape look
## identical from here. It also matters for cost: a room's walls are all one
## StaticBody3D, so cooking "the target" there would cook the entire room.
