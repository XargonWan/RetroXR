## Poster — a user image hung on a wall or stuck to an object.
##
## The image comes from ~/retroxr/posters/ (RomLibrary.scan_posters). Spawned from
## the menu, carried, and stuck to whatever surface it is released against; a stuck
## poster rides the object it is stuck to.
##
## PNG alpha is supported, so a die-cut sticker is as valid as a rectangle. The
## material for one is TRANSPARENCY_ALPHA_SCISSOR rather than ALPHA: scissor renders
## in the OPAQUE pass and keeps writing depth, and a poster that stops writing depth
## sorts per-triangle against the wall behind it and against the next poster along.
## That is the same trap paper.gdshader documents. An image with no alpha at all is
## left fully opaque — alpha testing costs early-Z on a tile GPU, so the cheap case
## must stay cheap.
