## KeyboardReceiver — the real keyboard, forwarded to the port it is plugged into.
##
## The virtual RetroKeyboard has to be HELD and Scroll-Lock captured before your
## typing reaches a core, which costs you a hand and a mode. This is the same
## thing as an object: seat it in a computer's port and type.
##
## ── Why there is no capture here ─────────────────────────────────────────────
## ScrollLockCapture makes the held board's hijacking of the keyboard opt-in,
## because holding a board is an ambiguous thing to be doing — you might merely be
## carrying it. Plugging a receiver in is not ambiguous. Seated is live, and the
## dongle is a visible object with a green light on it, which is easier to find
## again than a mode you toggled with a key.
##
## ── Which keyboard, and which of several receivers ───────────────────────────
## There is one keyboard, so there is nothing to select — unlike a gamepad, which
## names its device. Several RetroKeyboards can exist at once and the GRIP decides
## which of them your typing drives; a receiver is never held, so instead each one
## forwards to its own port and two seated receivers both receive. A fan-out, not
## an ambiguity: you cannot type at two machines at once, and seating two is how
## you asked for both.
##
## VR only — see the spawn menu. On desktop the real keyboard IS the player: WASD
## walks, and a dongle silently taking it would fight the controls you are
## standing on. Desktop keeps the held board and its capture, untouched.

## Typing into a menu field is not typing at the game. TypingGuard sets the
## suspension globally the moment a LineEdit takes focus — "the keyboard is one
## device, so if it is composing text it is not driving any held device" — and a
## receiver is no different for being unheld.
##
## Deliberately does NOT mark the event handled. The held RetroKeyboard does,
## to stop keys it has captured from also moving the player — but consuming here
## would mean the FIRST receiver to see a keystroke swallowed it, and the second
## machine got nothing. Two seated receivers are a fan-out, so every one of them
## has to see the same event. Safe because these are VR-only, where locomotion is
## the stick and no key moves the player.
