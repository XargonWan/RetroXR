## WiiLink — everything a Wii cabinet does that no other console does.
##
## Added as a child of the RetroSystem by system.gd when the console is a Wii
## (the same shape as HandheldInput), so every other machine leaves it null and
## reads none of this. Three jobs, all of them consequences of one fact: Dolphin
## exposes Wii Remotes and GameCube pads through the SAME four libretro ports.
##
##   • PAIRING — a remote has no cable, so it claims a port by handshake instead
##     of by plug: SYNC on the console opens a window, SYNC on the remote takes
##     the lowest free slot.
##   • ARBITRATION — each slot is one device or the other. The core enforces that
##     itself (announcing a remote drops the slot's GC pad and vice versa), so
##     retroXR has to make sure it never asks for both. A wired pad's cabinet
##     socket is fixed; a remote is wireless, so the remote is what moves.
##   • MODE — a Wii plays GameCube discs, and the core follows the DISC, not the
##     console. Which device id a wired pad is announced with depends on it.
##
## Four slots total across both kinds, which is every Wii game's player cap.
