## Plays a short clip once, spatialised, through SpatialAudioEmitter.
##
## The emitter is PCM-push only — there is no "play this AudioStream" entry point
## — so a one-shot cannot be an AudioStreamPlayer3D. It has to be pushed as frames
## like everything else, which is what this wraps up so each caller does not
## rewrite the push loop. CrtHum does the same thing for a looping source.
##
## Retriggering restarts from the beginning rather than layering. For a switch
## click that is right: the mechanism cannot be in two states at once, and two
## overlapping copies of the same transient comb-filter into something metallic.

## Hard cut. Inverse-distance attenuation only loses 6 dB per doubling, so without
## this a click would still be faintly audible across the room.
