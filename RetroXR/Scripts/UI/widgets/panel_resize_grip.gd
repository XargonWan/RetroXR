## PanelResizeGrip — the "_|" corner mark on a CurvedPanel: press and drag to
## resize the panel in x and y.
##
## A separate collider for the same reason KeyboardKeyField is one:
## InteractionResolver tests `is XRToolsPickable` before has_method("pointer_event"),
## so anything hung off a pickable has to be its own node to be pointed at rather
## than grabbed. On POINTABLE_LAYER it classifies as KIND_POINTER, which also
## means can_grab = false — pressing the grip cannot drag the whole panel.
##
## A StaticBody3D, not an Area3D. The VR laser's RayCast has
## collide_with_areas = false, so an area is invisible to it — which is how this
## shipped unclickable in VR. Nothing was lost by the change: it had already
## turned monitoring and monitorable off, i.e. every Area3D feature there is.
## The desktop path is unaffected, keying off has_method("pointer_event").
##
## The drag deliberately does NOT follow pointer MOVED events. Those stop the
## moment the cursor leaves this little area, which for a resize handle is
## immediately — that is the whole point of the gesture. Instead PRESSED records
## which pointer started it, and from then on the panel projects that pointer's
## own ray onto its plane every frame until RELEASED.
