## AchievementToast — the RetroAchievements unlock popup, on the cabinet.
##
## The spawn menu's toast stack is parented to the menu panel, so it is invisible
## while somebody is actually playing — which is exactly when an unlock happens.
## This is its own quad, anchored to the machine that earned it, so with two
## cabinets running you can see which one popped.
##
## Built the way ToastPanel builds its quad, and it inherits two settings from
## there that were expensive to learn: SCISSOR rather than alpha blending (a
## blended Viewport2DIn3D quad measured 57 drawn pixels against 14787 with
## blending off), and a scale that makes an 18 pt line readable across the room
## rather than 9 mm tall.
